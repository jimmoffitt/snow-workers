# snow-workers
Refactoring existing Ruby clients of the Twitter Search and Engagement APIs to add new features to the SnowBot.

The intent is to have a scheduled task that collects Tweets from the previous 24-hours and determing the Tweet with the most engagements, or a "Tweet of the Day." For this demo, the number of favorities/likes is used as a proxy for 'engagement.'
