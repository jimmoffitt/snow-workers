This flavor of the Engagement API client is based on this project: https://github.com/twitterdev/engagement-api-client-ruby

Its README serves as documentation of the inner-workings of this Snowbot version of the full client.

The Snowbot version is likely to have these differences:

* Support for the /totals endpoint only.
* Support for public metrics only.
